# Welcome to Quark Optical

## Who Are We?

Quark Optical was established in Digitalpark Teknokent in 2022 with the support of TÜBİTAK 1512. Since 2023, we have been conducting our design, product development, and manufacturing activities within Cube Incubation located in Teknopark Istanbul. We specialize in the development of competitive and niche products in the electro-optical and acoustic fields, starting with our flagship APD Module.

## Vision and Mission

At Quark Optical, we are committed to providing our customers with high quality, reliability, and durability in all our products. Our circuit boards are designed with unique features and carefully selected components to enhance technical superiority and performance. We prioritize customer satisfaction and adhere to stringent quality standards to establish ourselves as a trustworthy brand. In the electro-optical and acoustic fields, we aim to lead the industry through innovation and advanced technology, leveraging light-based information in our projects.

## Our Projects

### APD Module
The APD Module project, initiated in February 2022 with TÜBİTAK-1512 support, is foundational to our company. This sensor card converts light intensity into electrical signals, catering to applications requiring high-speed and precise light detection.

### SPAD Module
Currently in development, the SPAD Module counts individual photons falling on the sensor, similar to our APD Module, and aims to advance photon counting technology.

### Time Digital Converter and Correlation Device (TDCC)
Our TDCC device precisely measures time intervals between incoming signals, converting them into digital values per channel and facilitating correlation analysis. This capability enables us to identify similarities, delays, and matches between signals.
